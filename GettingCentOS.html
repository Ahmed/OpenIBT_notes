<h4><i>Introduction</i></h4>


<p><i>1-What&rsquo;s iso?</i></p>

<blockquote>
  An ISO image is an archive file of an optical disc, a type of disk image composed of the data contents from every
  written sector on an optical disc, including the optical disc file system.[1] ISO image files usually have a file
  extension of .iso. The name ISO is taken from the ISO 9660 file system used with CD-ROM media, but what is known as an
  ISO image might also contain a UDF (ISO/IEC 13346) file system (commonly used by DVDs and Blu-ray Discs).

<br><br>

<p>CentOS ISO file can be used to install CentOS from the DVD. In real life, probably you will not need this unless you
  are managing physical servers instead of virtual machines. Sometimes you might need to do some testing before
  migrating from a legacy to a new operating system.
</p>


<p>If you're planning to use a cloud provider, your cloud provider will give you images that are ready to deploy.
  For example, Amazon EC2 provides images that can be ready in few minutes to spin up a virtual machine. They do it by
  taking some of the resources from physical servers and give you a small access to it. &nbsp;Some enterprise
  corporations have their own internal version of Amazon EC2. There is a well-known platform called OpenStack. Same as
  EC2, you have a console and you will have the option to select any operating systems like CentOS to setup your virtual
  machine. I encourage you to watch all installation videos. They will help you to understand how to install CentOS
</p>
<br>

<p><i>2-Downloading CentOS</i></p>

<p>You have the option to download CentOS over HTTP, FTP, or even torrent. &nbsp;Torrent is the fastest way to download
  CentOS. Make sure you're allowed to use torrent on your company network. If you are using your home computer,
  there is good chance that torrent is not blocked. Contact your ISP if you&#39;re not sure.
</p>

<p>In order to download CentOS, please go to this website: <a href="https://www.centos.org/download/">https://www.centos.org/download/</a>
  and click on DVD ISO. If you want to use torrent, Click on more download choices, and select a torrent file. Make
  sure you have a torrent client installed on your computer
